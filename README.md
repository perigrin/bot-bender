# Phenwick

For several years now at someone's request (Robin Berjon I think), I have been
running an instance of [phenny][http://inamidst.com/phenny/] on irc.perl.org.
She's a very useful bot, with many useful things she can do.

She's also python.

Which I don't know.

So I've started porting her functionality to Perl in the form of `phenwick`.
